## System Memory
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/chiyanglin-AStar/SSD_Storage_Cloud_Technologies#table-of-contents)

[NAND Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_Flash) is a type flash memory where cells are connected in series, resembling a [CMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS) NAND gate. Flash memory is used in computers, PDAs, digital audio players, digital cameras, mobile phones, synthesizers, video games, scientific instrumentation, industrial robotics, and medical electronics.

[3D Vertical NAND (V-NAND)](https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/global.semi.static/2bit_V-NAND_technology_White_Paper-1.pdf) is a unique NAND flash memory design by Samsung where planar NAND (single planes of NAND cells) are stacked vertically and boasts a cell-to-cell interference-free structure using Charge Trap Flash (CTF) technology. This change in vertical arrangement of cells these SSDs have better capacities at lower production costs, half the power requirements, twice the speed and ten times the longevity of planar NAND.

[Charge trap flash (CTF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_trap_flash) is a semiconductor memory technology used in creating non-volatile NOR and NAND flash memory. It's a type of floating-gate MOSFET memory technology, but differs from the conventional floating-gate technology in that it uses a silicon nitride film to store electrons rather than the doped polycrystalline silicon typical of a floating-gate structure.

[NOR Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory#NOR_flash) is a type flash memory where each cell has one end connected directly to ground, and the other end connected directly to a bit line.

[Universal Flash Storage (UFS)](https://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/focus/flash/universal-flash-storage-ufs) is an open standard, high-performance interface designed for use in applications where power consumption needs to be minimized, including mobile systems such as smartphones and tablets as well as automotive applications. Its high-speed serial interface and optimized protocol enable significant improvements in throughput and system performance.

[Flash Translation Layer (FTL)](https://mydatarecoverylab.com/flash-translation-layer/) is designed and tested to handle unexpected system resets cleanly. If a write is initiated during a system reset, and not completed, then the old state of the logical sector being addressed will be presented on start-up. If the write operation was complete, then the new state of the logical sector will be read. No in-between states or complex recovery procedures are required.

[Intel® Optane™ memory](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/memory-storage/optane-memory.html) is a standalone memory device that is different from all the rest. It streamlines your computing experience by combining storage capacity and intelligent system acceleration.

[Memory module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_module) is a printed circuit board on which memory integrated circuits are mounted. Memory modules permit easy installation and replacement in electronic systems such as personal computers, workstations, and servers.

[CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor)](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/cmos.htm) is a small amount of memory on a computer motherboard that stores the BIOS settings. These BIOS settings include the system time and date, as well as hardware settings.

[Random Access Memory (RAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory) is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code. A random access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory, in contrast with other direct-access data storage media.

[Non-Volatile Random Access Memory (NVRAM)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2794/non-volatile-random-access-memory-nvram) is a category of Random Access Memory (RAM) that retains stored data even if the power is switched off. NVRAM uses a tiny 24-pin dual inline package (DIP) integrated circuit chip, which helps it to gain the power required to function from the CMOS battery on the motherboard.

[Embedded MultiMediaCard (eMMC)](https://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/hardware/emmc-storage/)  is an internal data storage card, built using flash storage.Its tiny size and low price make it a popular choice for data storage in portable devices like smartphones, tablets, cameras, and laptops.

[Error Correction Code (ECC) memory](https://www.crucial.com/products/memory/server/ecc) is a method of detecting and then correcting single-bit memory errors. A single-bit memory error is a data error in server output or production, and the presence of errors can have a big impact on server performance. The two types of single-bit memory errors: **hard errors and soft errors**. **Hard errors** are caused by physical factors, such as excessive temperature variation, voltage stress, or physical stress brought upon the memory bits. **Soft errors** occur when data is written or read differently than originally intended, such as variations in voltage on the motherboard, to cosmic rays or radioactive decay that can cause bits in the memory to flip.

[EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory)](https://www.futureelectronics.com/c/semiconductors/memory--RAM--eeprom) is a type of non-volatile memory used in integrated in microcontrollers for smart cards/remote keyless systems, and other electronic devices to store relatively small amounts of data by allowing individual bytes to be erased and reprogrammed as needed in an application.

[EPROM](https://www.minitool.com/lib/eprom.html) is a memory chip that does not lose data even when the power is switched off. This is a non-volatile memory type so it retains data even when the power is switched off. Each EPROM is individually programmed by an electronic device.

[Virtual memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory) is a memory management technique that is implemented by using both hardware (central processing unit (CPU)) and software. It makes a program think it has available storage space or address space. When actually virtual memory usually is divided into several physical memory fragments, and stored on the disk storage(SSD or HDD) which can be used to exchange data when needed. On Windows this is called a [Pagefile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/introduction-page-file) or on Linux a [Swap space](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/storage_administration_guide/ch-swapspace).

[Secure virtual memory](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/what-is-secure-virtual-memory-on-mac-mh11852/mac) is a technique used in macOS that encrypts the data in virtual memory. Secure virtual memory is always on, so data is kept secure while it’s swapped between your hard disk and RAM. The RAM on your Mac contains no information when it’s off.

[Memory-Mapped Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/io/memory-mapped-files) is a technique that contains the contents of a file in virtual memory. This mapping between a file and memory space enables an application, including multiple processes, to modify the file by reading and writing directly to the memory. You can use managed code to access memory-mapped files in the same way that native Windows functions access memory-mapped files

[Bcache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcache) is a cache in the Linux kernel's block layer, which is used for accessing secondary storage devices. It allows one or more fast storage devices, such as flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs), to act as a cache for one or more slower storage devices, such as hard disk drives (HDDs). This effectively creating hybrid volumes and provides performance improvements.

## SSD Interfaces
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/chiyanglin-AStar/SSD_Storage_Cloud_Technologies#table-of-contents)

[Serial ATA (SATA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SATA) is a computer bus interface that connects host bus adapters to mass storage devices such as hard disk drives, optical drives, and solid-state drives.

[M.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.2) is a specification for internally mounted computer expansion cards and associated connectors. M.2 replaces the [mSATA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSATA) standard, which uses the PCI Express Mini Card physical card layout and connectors.

[NVM Express (NVMe)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVM_Express) is an open, logical-device interface specification for accessing a computer's non-volatile storage media usually attached via PCI Express (PCIe) bus.

[PCI Express (PCIe)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express) is a high-speed serial computer expansion bus standard, designed to replace the older PCI, PCI-X and AGP bus standards.

## C/C++ Learning Resources

[C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/) is a cross-platform language that can be used to build high-performance applications developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

[C](https://www.iso.org/standard/74528.html) is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. It supports structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. C also provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, which makes it one was of the most widely used programming languages today.

[Embedded C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_C) is a set of language extensions for the C programming language by the [C Standards Committee](https://isocpp.org/std/the-committee) to address issues that exist between C extensions for different [embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system). The extensions hep enhance microprocessor features such as fixed-point arithmetic, multiple distinct memory banks, and basic I/O operations. This makes Embedded C the most popular embedded software language in the world.
